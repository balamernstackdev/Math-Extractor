# ✅ Quick Fix Applied!

## What Was Done

I've removed these large files from Git tracking:

1. ✅ `dist/MathpixClone.exe` - **748 MB** (executable)
2. ✅ `data/mathml/mathml_20251215_150430.xml` - Generated file
3. ✅ `tests/1300000044.pdf` - **1.47 MB** (test file)

## Next Step: Push to GitHub

```bash
git push origin main
```

**Note:** This push will still be large (~900 MB) because Git needs to remove these files from the repository. But:

- ✅ Files are now removed from Git tracking
- ✅ `.gitignore` will prevent them from being added again
- ✅ Future pushes will be **much smaller** (only code changes)

## After This Push

Your repository will be:
- **Before**: ~900 MB
- **After**: ~10-50 MB (only source code)
- **Future pushes**: ~1-5 MB (only code changes)

## Verify It Worked

After pushing, check your GitHub repo size - it should be much smaller!

## Summary

✅ Large files removed from Git  
✅ `.gitignore` updated (prevents re-adding)  
✅ Ready to push  
⏳ Next: `git push origin main`
